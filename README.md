- Add a new book by pressing the '+' button 
- Delete a book by pressing the 'X' button an the book
- Toggle the status of a book by checking/unchecking the 'Read' checkbox
- Filter the library based on status by selecting: 'All', 'Read', 'Unread'
- Responsive design/mobile friendly
- On load/refresh, the library is populated with some sample books for demo purposes 

Known limitations: 
- Currently there is no local storage of data, or backend/database to save data between loads. Therefore every refresh will reset the library to the initial state.
